# ZHONG

A minimalist, Pokémon-themed web app that combines a Pomodoro-style timer with a private daily journal. All data stays in your browser.

## Features

- 25‑minute focus timer with start, pause, and reset controls
- Journal entries saved by date in `localStorage`
- Expand entries to read or edit
- Attach images or videos to journal entries
- Calming, responsive layout with playful Pokémon styling and subtle animations
- Smoothly animated circular countdown with progress ring

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The date field defaults to today; write a reflection and press **Save Entry**. Click past entries to expand or edit them.

Entries and timer data are stored locally in `localStorage`. Clearing browser data removes them. The site can be hosted as static files, e.g. with GitHub Pages.
