## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The date field defaults to today; write a reflection and press **Save Entry**. Click past entries to expand or edit them.

Entries and timer data are stored locally in `localStorage`. Clearing browser data removes them. The site can be hosted as static files, e.g. with GitHub Pages.
